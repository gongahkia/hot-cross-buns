// Past-cleanup engine. Pure functions that inspect the current mirrors
// and the user's settings, decide what to delete, and issue the deletes
// through AppModel's existing mutation paths (so optimistic writes,
// offline queue, and audit logging all flow the same way). Visibility-
// only modes (dim / hide) are handled in views — this service is only
// about deletion.
//
// Operates in two phases per invocation:
//   1. computePreview() — dry run; returns the list of candidates.
//   2. execute(preview:) — fires deletes; returns counts + errors.
// Callers can show the preview to the user before execute, or skip the
// preview and go straight to execute for silent recurring sweeps after
// the user has acknowledged once.
//
// Safety rules baked in:
//   - Recurring master events (event.recurrence non-empty AND id has no
//     instance suffix) are NEVER deleted. The series stays alive.
//   - Past instances of recurring events (event.id has the _YYYYMMDD…
//     suffix) are fair game.
//   - Events with attendees are skipped unless the user has explicitly
//     opted in (allowDeletingAttendeeEvents). Deleting an attendee event
//     may notify/cancel for other people, so this requires consent.
//   - Completed tasks only — overdue-but-open tasks are never deleted.
//     Hiding overdue tasks is allowed (view-layer), never deletion.
